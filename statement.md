# Student Record Management System – Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
Managing student information manually often results in misplaced records, difficulty locating details, inconsistent updates, and overall disorganized data. Simple tasks such as checking a student's course, CGPA, or state become slow and error-prone when information is not stored properly.

This project solves these challenges by providing a Python-based Student Record Management System that stores data using nested dictionaries. The system offers structured storage, fast lookup, and easy modification of records through a simple menu-driven interface.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The project focuses on building a beginner-friendly system that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Python programming. The scope includes:

- A command-line, menu-driven interface  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- In-memory storage using nested dictionaries  
- Modular and readable code design  
- Displaying all student records in a formatted manner  

The project intentionally excludes advanced features such as database storage, file handling, or graphical interfaces, keeping it simple and instructional.

## 3. Target Users
This project is intended for:

- **Students learning Python**  
  Beginners practicing loops, functions, dictionaries, and input handling.

- **Educators and instructors**  
  Teachers who want to demonstrate basic CRUD logic and data structures.

- **Beginner programmers**  
  Those who want a simple project to build confidence and practice coding.

- **Project-based learners**  
  Students preparing small academic or practice assignments.

## 4. High-Level Features
The system provides the following core features:

- **Add Student Records**  
  Allows entry of registration number, name, course, CGPA, and state.

- **Search Student Records**  
  Locate and display specific student details using the registration number.

- **Update Student Information**  
  Edit any stored field such as name, course, CGPA, or state.

- **Delete Student Records**  
  Remove a specific student from the system.

- **Display All Students**  
  View all stored records in an organized format.

- **Single-File Implementation**  
  The system runs entirely from one Python file and requires no external libraries.
